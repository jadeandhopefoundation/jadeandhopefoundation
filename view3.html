   <h2>Our Projects</h2>
  <p>
Our foundation aims to help the underprivileged through various acts of charity, both locally and abroad. We believe that by providing underprivileged children with the proper education and by having their basic needs met, the children will have an opportunity for a better life and future. For instance, by providing after school tutoring for these children, it would not only provide the help that their parents may not be able to provide also their parents with opportunities to find work and provide for their families as well. The Foundation also intends to provide educational resources to underprivileged children by way of providing educational tools, books, providing a part of the enrollment fees (donations) to various additional programs to develop such skills. Other than that, our foundation will hold counseling classes for individuals who want to study further. The foundation will hold such sessions for a very subsidized fee, or free, and invite experts from various fields to provide inputs to such individuals. The foundation will also help the seniors to develop basic computer skills, so they can retain their jobs for a longer duration. Classes will be available for no charge to seniors. The Jade and Hope Foundation is a U.S. based charitable, non-profit operating foundation committed to improving the lives of the underprivileged. The Jade and Hope Foundation administers its own projects either independently or in conjunction with other non-profit organizations. Projects may vary in structure and involve a variety of disciplines and activities, all with the ultimate goal of achieving the above purposes.
